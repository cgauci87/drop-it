reusable code
validation in terms of deletion (Are you sure you want to delete this?)
validation re. email address

login in / log out / register / validation


detailed testing - how did you do test the functionalities?

Use Selenium for browser-based regression automation suites and tests

plan models - multiple modules are a must.
model - how the database would be structerd.

database diagram
schema
authentication schema
20 entries of data in database is suffient just to showcase only.
